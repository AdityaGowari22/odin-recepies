    <h1>What is a Mutton Biryani</h1>
    <p class="recipe-description">Mutton biryani is a classic and aromatic rice dish, made with tender pieces of mutton (goat meat) marinated in a blend of spices and yogurt. The meat is layered with long-grain basmati rice, saffron-infused milk, and fried onions. The biryani is then cooked in a sealed pot, allowing the flavors to meld together perfectly. This mouthwatering dish is popular in Indian, Pakistani, and Middle Eastern cuisines and is often served with raita or a side salad for a complete and satisfying meal. The combination of tender mutton, fragrant rice, and a medley of spices makes mutton biryani a cherished delicacy for biryani enthusiasts.</p>

        <li>1 onion, sliced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon saffron</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons warm milk</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h2>Now that you have gathered the Ingredients, follow the <em class="instructions">Directions</em></h2>
    Bring the rice, 7 1/2 cups water, and 1 teaspoon salt to a boil in a saucepan until the rice is nearly done yet a little chewy, 10 to 15 minutes; drain any excess water.</p>

    <ol class="directions-list">
        <li>Place the basmati rice in a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand 30 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Heat 1/4 cup oil in a large skillet over medium heat; fry the cloves, cardamom pods, and cinnamon sticks in the hot oil until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the onions; cook and stir until the onions are lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Stir the garlic paste and ginger paste into the onion mixture; cook until the garlic and ginger are fragrant, about 1 minute more. Sprinkle the cilantro and mint over the mixture and cook 1 minute more.</li>
        <li>Add the lamb chops to the skillet; season with salt. Cook and stir the lamb until the meat begins to brown, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir the tomatoes, green chile peppers, and ground red pepper into the mixture; continue cooking until the oil begins to separate from the gravy, about 10 minutes. Add the yogurt and lemon juice; cover and cook until the lamb is tender, about 15 minutes. Add water as needed to keep the mixture from getting too dry.</li>
        <li>Bring the rice, 7 1/2 cups water, and 1 teaspoon salt to a boil in a saucepan until the rice is nearly done yet a little chewy, 10 to 15 minutes; drain any excess water.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a small skillet; fry the sliced onion in the hot oil until lightly browned.</li>
        <li>Layer about half the rice in the bottom of a deep pot with a lid. Spoon the lamb masala over the rice. Spread the fried onion over the lamb masala. Top with the remaining rice. Stir the saffron and warm milk together in a small bowl; pour over the top layer of rice. Cover the pot with the lid and place the pot over low heat; cook until the rice is thoroughly cooked, about 15 minutes.</li>
